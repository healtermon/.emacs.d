* My Emacs Config
Welcome to my emacs setup! Sorry it's not literate, and always in a mess, but hopefully it helps!

** Main Features
package manager:
- straight
configuration macros:
- leaf (trying to transition to this, mostly done.)
- once
- use-package (ugh can't get rid of custom-face forms)

** What each file is for
- early-init.el is for optimisations like disabling loading with package.el so that the init loads faster 
- init.el is the 1 massive config file. download it and use emacs to browse it!
- templates is for tempel.el, have a look at the cryptic snippet templates written in lisp data!
- eshell/alias holds eshell aliases
- straight folder contains my lockfiles, I've never used them and I regret it.
