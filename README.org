* My Emacs Config
Welcome to my emacs setup! Sorry it's not literate, and always in a mess, but hopefully it helps!
package manager: straight
configuration macros: leaf use-package once

** What each file is for
- early-init.el is mainly to disable garbage collection during startup so that the init loads faster 
- init.el is the 1 massive config file. download it and use emacs to browse it!
- templates is for tempel.el, have a look at the cryptic snippet templates written in lisp data!
